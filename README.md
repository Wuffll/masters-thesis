# Master's thesis

## Requirements

-   OpenGL 4.5
-   MS Visual Studio 2022

## Build steps

Once you have cloned the repository, make sure to do the following steps.

1.  Unzip the Dependencies.zip file (compressed due to GitHub file size restrictions)
2.  The project is set up to work for the following configurations: x64 (Debug) and x64 (Release)
3.  In case you run into any problem, take a look at the following section (Troubleshooting problems)

## Troubleshooting problems

There are several things to keep in mind when the program isn't able to execute or throws an exception.

1.  Check the command line for debug messages. I've implemented console debug output for better error checking/tracing.
2.  If you find any issues, please forward them to me and I will put it up here until it is fixed.
